        </h1><p> Done for a fictional event of “wharf wrestling”. The website uses on scroll animations, allowing the user to experience it at their own pace. The type in the water is movable on a click and drag. The goal for the website was to create something that was dynamic and explosive, but also allowed the user to shape their own experience.
