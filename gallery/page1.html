    <div class="text_box"><h1>Interactive Q investigations
        </h1><p>An investigation in letterforms, specifically in exploring a letterform in the 3d. I choose to focus on the letter “Q” in the light weight of American typewriter, being that it has a very nice whimsical form. I worked with different ways of speaking through the letter in 3D materials and Photoshop. The front cover page was built to allow the viewer to interact and play with the letter, in a similar way that I did over the course of developing this piece. The website was built from scratch using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. <a href="https://aricknowles.github.io/Q/" target="_blank">&rarr;</a>
